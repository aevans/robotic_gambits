- Functionality to select from a set of actions to perform when the condition is met
- Adding and removing rules from the set
2. Import / Export rulesets to a common, portable file format
3. Customize the list of available variables and actions for specific robotics platforms or use-cases
4. Backend system to process an exported ruleset for use with a specific robotics platform or simulation
5. Updated backend processing to simulate communications time-lag
6. Example interactive rulesets and related educational components
- Basic wall hugging robot for solving mazes, toggle left or right wall hugging behavior by toggling certain rules on or off
- Basic navigation exercise to adjust heading based on sensor input, control the navigation by adjusting rules for desired heading, speed, etc
